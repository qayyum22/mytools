const markdown = `Choosing between rendering code in codeblocks or Markdown depends on several factors including your use case, platform capabilities, and desired user experience. Here's a breakdown to help you decide:

### Codeblocks:

**Pros:**
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Codeblocks can offer syntax highlighting out of the box, making the code more readable and visually appealing.
- **Interactive Elements**: You can add interactive elements like the copy button, line numbers, or even inline editing features.
- **Custom Styling**: Full control over the appearance, including fonts, colors, and layout.
- **Accessibility**: Can be made more accessible with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.

**Cons:**
- **Complexity**: Requires more setup, especially if you're implementing it from scratch or using a library like Prism.js or Highlight.js.
- **Performance**: If not optimized, rendering large codebases might impact performance due to syntax highlighting and styling.

### Markdown:

**Pros:**
- **Simplicity**: Easy to write and read. Markdown is lightweight and straightforward for content creators.
- **Universal**: Markdown is widely supported across platforms and tools, making it highly portable.
- **Quick Rendering**: Generally faster to render since it's plain text with minimal formatting.

**Cons:**
- **Limited Styling**: While you can get basic syntax highlighting with some Markdown parsers, it's not as customizable or feature-rich as dedicated codeblocks.
- **No Interactive Features**: Typically, you can't add interactive elements like copy buttons directly within Markdown without additional JavaScript.

### Recommendations:

- **For Static Content or Documentation**: **Markdown** might be sufficient if you're looking for simplicity and don't need advanced features. Many platforms support basic syntax highlighting for Markdown code blocks (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

- **For Interactive or Complex Applications**: **Codeblocks** are better if you're building an application where users might interact with the code (like copying, editing, or running code snippets), or if you need custom styling and features.

- **Hybrid Approach**: You can also use a hybrid approach where Markdown is used for the content, and for code snippets where you need more control, you embed custom codeblocks. This is common in static site generators or documentation tools like Docz or Docusaurus.

- **Accessibility and SEO**: If your content needs to be highly accessible or SEO-friendly, consider how your code rendering affects screen readers or search engine crawlers. Codeblocks with proper ARIA attributes might offer an edge here.

- **Performance Considerations**: If performance is a concern, especially with large codebases, Markdown might be lighter on resources compared to heavily styled codeblocks.

Ultimately, the "better" option depends on your specific needs, the tools at your disposal, and how much control you want over the presentation and interaction with the code. If you're developing a platform where code presentation is a core feature, custom codeblocks would likely be the way to go. For simpler documentation or content where ease of writing and rendering speed are prioritized, Markdown might be more suitable.`
